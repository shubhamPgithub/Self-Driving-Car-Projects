This final assignment for Course 3 covers following topics

 1. Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement
    drivable space estimation in 3D.
 2. Use the output of semantic segmentation neural networks to implement
    lane estimation.
 3. Use the output of semantic segmentation to filter errors in the
    output of 2D object detectors.
 4. Use the filtered 2D object detection results to determine how far
    obstacles are from the self-driving car.
