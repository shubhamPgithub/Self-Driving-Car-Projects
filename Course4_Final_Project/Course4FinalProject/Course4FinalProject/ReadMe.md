# Course 4 Final Project

In this project we will be implementing many of the behavioral and local planning concepts discussed in Course 4. The goal of this project will be to have a functional motion planning stack that can avoid both static and dynamic obstacles while tracking the center line of a lane, while also handling stop signs. To accomplish this, you will have to implement behavioral planning logic, as well as static collision checking, path selection, and velocity profile generation.
