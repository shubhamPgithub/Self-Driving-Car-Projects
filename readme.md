This folder contains code for Final Project for 'Self-Driving Car' course.

For the last week of the course, the assignment project is to get hands on with a simulation of an autonomous vehicle that requires longitudinal and lateral vehicle control design to track a predefined path along a racetrack with a given speed profile.  The speed profile and/or path were allowed to modify in order to improve their lap time, without any requirement to do so.
The project was great work and play excercise to learn Vehicle control problem.
