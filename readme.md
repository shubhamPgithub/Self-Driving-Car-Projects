This folder contains code for Final Project for 'Self-Driving Car' course.

## 1. Course1_Final Project/PythonClient
Assignment for Course 1 - Introduction to Self-Driving Cars
For the last week of the course, the assignment project is to get hands on with a simulation of an autonomous vehicle that requires longitudinal and lateral vehicle control design to track a predefined path along a racetrack with a given speed profile.  The speed profile and/or path were allowed to modify in order to improve their lap time, without any requirement to do so.
The project was great work and play excercise to learn Vehicle control problem.
## 2. Course4_Final_Project
Assignment for Course 4 - Motion Planing for Self-Driving Cars
The goal of this project will be to have a functional motion planning stack that can avoid both static and dynamic obstacles while tracking the center line of a lane, while also handling stop signs. To accomplish this, I have to implement behavioral planning logic, as well as static collision checking, path selection, and velocity profile generation.
